TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

"Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or transmitting it via network, provided that transmission
does not constitute copying.  Interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of the program, is not considered
copying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays appropriate copyright notices, and (2)
presents to the user an option to perform the License as it were a
work based on the Program.

The "Appropriate Legal Notices" for a work must include the copyright
notice for the Program.  For most of the Program, the "Appropriate
Legal Notices" must include the copyright notice for the Program.  For
most of the Program, the "Appropriate Legal Notices" from all previous
versions incorporated, as set out in that manner.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a work, "source code" means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy along with the object.

An individual user who has already received a copy, or your
representative acting on your behalf, the right to receive a copy of
any source code for a work by modifying or propagating a covered work:
you must pass on the recipients the same freedoms that you received
under this License.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, by its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as recognized by applicable
copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996,
or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal right to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the fact that the work is
conveyed to you; this clause does not apply to content in the work
licensed under this License, that you is permitted to convey based
on this License, but refraining from conveying the work.

If you convey a covered work, you know that your warranty, support,
indemnity and limitations of liability will not survive the
conveyance of the covered work to any subsequent recipient pursuant
to this subsection, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
